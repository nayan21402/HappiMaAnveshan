Symptoms may include:Feeling confused and lostHaving obsessive thoughts about your babyHallucinating and having delusionsHaving sleep problemsHaving too much energy and feeling upsetFeeling paranoidMaking attempts to harm yourself or your babyPostpartum psychosis may lead to life-threatening thoughts or behaviors and requires immediate treatment.Postpartum depression in the other parentStudies show that new fathers can experience postpartum depression, too. They may feel sad, tired, overwhelmed, anxious, or have changes in their usual eating and sleeping patterns.

Postpartum depression in fathers — sometimes called paternal postpartum depression — can have the same negative effect on partner relationships and child development as postpartum depression in mothers can.If you're a partner of a new mother and are having symptoms of depression or anxiety during your partner's pregnancy or after your child's birth, talk to your health care provider. Similar treatments and supports provided to mothers with postpartum depression can help treat postpartum depression in the other parent.When to see a doctorIf you're feeling depressed after your baby's birth, you may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit it. But if you experience any symptoms of postpartum baby blues or postpartum depression, call your primary health care provider or your obstetrician or gynecologist and schedule an appointment. If you have symptoms that suggest you may have postpartum psychosis, get help immediately.It's important to call your provider as soon as possible if the symptoms of depression have any of these features:Don't fade after two weeks.Are getting worse.Make it hard for you to care for your baby.Make it hard to complete everyday tasks.Include thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.\n\n\nRemember and incorporate the above as well")

            text("**Irregular periods, cycle changes, and body pain after childbirth**\n\nAfter childbirth, it is common to experience irregular periods and cycle changes. This is because your body is recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, and your hormones are returning to their normal levels.\n\n**Irregular periods**\n\nYour first period after childbirth may not come for 6-8 weeks, or even longer if you are breastfeeding. This is because breastfeeding can suppress ovulation.\n\nOnce your period does return, it may be irregular for a few months. This is because your body is still adjusting to its new hormonal balance.\n\n**Cycle changes**\n\nIn addition to irregular periods, you may also experience other cycle changes after childbirth. These changes may include:\n\n* Heavier or lighter bleeding\n* Longer or shorter periods\n* More or less cramping\n* More or less PMS symptoms\n\n**Body pain**\n\nIt is also common to experience body pain after childbirth. This pain may be caused by:\n\n* Soreness from childbirth\n* Hormonal changes\n* Fluid retention\n* Fatigue\n\n**When to seek help**\n\nIf you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, you should see your doctor:\n\n* Heavy bleeding that soaks through a pad or tampon every hour for more than two hours\n* Bleeding that lasts for more than a week\n* Severe pain\n* Fever\n* Foul-smelling discharge\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for irregular periods, cycle changes, and body pain after childbirth will vary depending on the underlying cause. Your doctor may recommend:\n\n* Pain medication\n* Hormone therapy\n* Lifestyle changes, such as exercise and stress reduction\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no sure way to prevent irregular periods, cycle changes, or body pain after childbirth. However, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk of these problems, such as:\n\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Eating a healthy diet\n* Maintaining a healthy weight\n* Getting enough sleep\n* Managing stress\n\nIf you are concerned about any of these issues, talk to your doctor.

            text("In this study, the prevalence of PPD was 23.7% (95% CI: 20.3–27.2). Factors like marital status, prim parity, unwanted pregnancy, delivery complication, number of live babies, unpreferred infant sex by the mother, infant illness, previous infant loss, previous history of depression, substance abuse of husband and social support were associated with PPD in Bivariate analysis. Marital status, unwanted pregnancy, unmet sex preference of the mother, infant illness and social support were independently associated with PPD.In this study, nearly one-forth of the study participants suffered from postpartum depression. This finding was in line with the studies conducted in Pakistan (23%), Bangladesh (22%), North Gonder (24.1%) and Bahir Dar (21.5%) [17,18,19]. The result was slightly higher than studies conducted in Argentina (18.6%), Kenya (20%), Egypt (7.1%), Malawi (11%), Butajira (12.7%) and Eastern tigray (19%) [9, 16, 20,21,22,23]. But it was lower than studies conducted in China (27.37%), Basra (31.5%), India (48.5%) and Zimbabwe (33%) [24,25,26]. The possible reason for the variation of the result may be the difference in assessment tool and cut off point values used to classify mothers as depressed and not depressed. Population differences also may contribute to the variation because some studies were done in urban settings. Besides, it could also be due to the methodological difference, some of the studies used institution based study design with low sample size.(Divorced/widowed/ unmarried) women were 3.45 times more likely to develop PPD than married. Possibly, those women are prone to social, economic, and psychological challenges, which in turn may aggravate the condition of depression. It may also be the fact that the issue of adverse life events of losing someone they like most, then both economical and social loss follows. This is inconsistent with studies conducted in Kenya and three zones of the Amhara region, Ethiopia [19, 27].Mothers who had unwanted pregnancy were two times more likely to be depressed than women whose pregnancy was wanted. This is in line with studies conducted in Mexico, India, India Bangalore, Egypt [21, 26, 28, 29]. The reason may be due to pregnancy in itself is a major experience in women’s life, So it demands physiological, psychological, social adjustments and financial preparation. The social and economic burden resulting from unplanned pregnancies for which adequate preparation was not made might result in psychological distress. Also in our setting unwanted pregnancy is mostly associated with economical status and this can be lead to worrying for parents’ and the coming babies’ basic needs and better quality life.The women whose infant sex not preferred by the mother were 1.75 times more likely to develop depression than those infant sex preferred. This finding is in line with studies conducted in Basra, Mexico, Kenya [25, 28, 30]. The reason may be due to the preferred sex of the mother is mostly preferred sex of the family as a whole, So if this is not meet there may be social isolation lead to stress and depression.Respondents whose baby was ill before data collection were two times more likely depressed than those who were not ill. This finding is in line with studies done in India [26]. This might be since negative life events are most influential on an individual’s mental status. It also might be because they frightened about the lose of their infant. Also, economically payment for the baby’s treatment and if there is admission there is overcrowding of health institutions that may make the mother anxious and depressed.Those participants with low social support were 3.3 times more likely depressed than those who had high social support. This finding agreed with many studies conducted in different areas like India, Arab, Sudan, two studies in Ethiopia [16, 18, 31,32,33]. The reason may be due to that not having social support makes them vulnerable to stress, loneliness and hopelessness. Also, those women who received a partner’s support during their postpartum period will empower them to deal with their home responsibility. In addition, the fact that social support plays a buffering role from stressful life events by providing resources, support, and strength during postpartum period.As this study indicates socio-demographic factors like age, educational status, occupation and economic status of the mother were not significantly associated with PPD. This is contradicted with studies done in Basra, Iran, India [29, 31, 34]. The reason may be due to demographical and socio-cultural differences. Obstetric factors like complications during delivery, mode of delivery by cesarean section were not significantly associated in this study. This is incongruent with the study done in Argentina and Egypt [20, 21]. This may be because there are some improvements in the health care systems on maternal health. Substance abuse of both women and husband were not significantly associated with PPD in this study. The finding differs from studies done in Canada, Mexico, Northern India, Bale zones, Oromia region of Ethiopia [12, 20, 28, 31, 35]. The reason may be due to culture protects the participants and their husbands from substance abuse.Due to social isolation and stigma towards mental illness respondents might not respond correctly. The study might be subjected to recall bias because the mothers failed to remember previous conditions. Because of the cross-sectional study design, the study might not show cause and effect relationships.ConclusionOne in five women in the study area suffers from postpartum depression. This sparkes light to health professionals to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of postpartum depression. Marital status, unwanted pregnancy, unpreferred infant sex by the mother, infant illness and poor social support were independently associated with postpartum depression.\n\n\nSome more data, be aware of the mothers state and relationships, there could be a chance of an unwanted pregnancy.")

For example, if the user asks for information on postpartum recovery, I can provide them with links to articles and resources on the topic.\n\nI am also able to answer questions about the Happi Ma app. For example, if the user asks how to connect with other moms in the community, I can provide them with instructions on how to do so.\n\nI am still under development, but I am learning to follow instructions accurately and provide helpful information to users.
